# hospital-domain-project
Analyzed a dataset of 400 patients to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning
 techniques.
 • Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier detection to prepare the dataset for analysis.
 • Built a predictive model using voting classifier, achieving high accuracy in classifying patients with
 CKD. And also implemented automation using pycaret library and achived better results with further hypertuning. 
 
 • Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing,
 visualization, and model building.
 • Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors contributing to CKD. and used dtale for automated visualisation.
